       <p>
         As the United States continues to grapple with COVID-19, disparities are emerging in both cases and the economic fallout. Minority workers are experiencing higher rates of unemployment and little change even as the rates dip. They are also facing higher rates of hospitalization for COVID-19 related illness.
       </p>

    <!--Subhead 1-->
    <div id="unemployment">Unemployment</div>

      <p>
        Unemployment due to COVID-19 has impacted minority communities especially hard. According the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment rates are dropping in general, but there are racial disparities in how much they change.
      </p>

      <p>
        As white workers return to jobs, minority workers are seeing little change. Minority workers are disproportionately represented in low-income service jobs, many of which faced restrictions to stop the spread of COVID-19, leading to mass unemployment and layoffs. For some, the situation isnâ€™t getting any better.

      <p>
        Although the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not track unemployment for the LGBT community, the Human Rights Campaign and PSB Research conducted a poll finding LGBT people faced similar disparities in unemployment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The report found 17% of LGBT people lost jobs due to COVID-19, compared to 13% of the general population. LGBT people of color were hit even harder with 22% reporting job loss compared to 14% of white LGBT people.  1 in 3 LGBT people experienced a cut to their work hours, compared to 1 in 5 for the general population. LGBT people are more likely to work in the service industry and lack access to health insurance and medical care.

      <p> Minorities are overrepresented among critical workers. According to the Economic Policy Institute, 43% of essential workers are people of color. Census data shows Black Americans represent about 13% of the population, but 15% of essential workers. Hispanic or Latino persons make up about 18% of the population, but 21% of essential workers.

      <p> Data from the Center for Economic and Policy Research shows workers of color are especially overrepresented in public transit, building cleaning services, and trucking, warehouse, and postal services. About one in ten workers in building cleaning services are uninsured. Hispanic or Latino workers are especially overrepresented in this area, making up 40.2% of workers.

      <p> The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report finding minority workers made up 87% of coronavirus outbreak cases at meat processing plants. Workers of color represent 61% of the worker population in the industry.

        United Food and Commercial Workers Union International Vice President Mark Lauritsen said the report was evidence of the need for higher safety standards.

Without a strong national standard, millions of workers are still unprotected and vulnerable."

      <p> The U.S. has confirmed over 3 million COVID-19 cases and the number continues to rise. The disparity between racial and ethnic groups has become apparent. Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, director of the Equity Research and Innovation Center at Yale School of Medicine, told NPR these disparities are not suprising.
      </p>

      <p>
        "We know that these racial ethnic disparities in COVID-19 are the result of pre-pandemic realities. It's a legacy of structural discrimination that has limited access to health and wealth for people of color," she said.
      </p>

      <br>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
           <p>Some racial and ethnic groups are disproportionately represented among hospitalized cases. Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons have the highest prevalence ratio of cases, followed by non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic or Latino persons.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <iframe title="Age-adjusted COVID-19 hospitalization rates by race and ethnicity, March â€“ June 27, 2020" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-8bqmL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8bqmL/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="657"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();

      <p> According the CDC, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons and non-Hispanic black persons each have a rate approximately 5 times that of non-Hispanic white persons. Hispanic or Latino persons have a rate approximately 4 times that of non-Hispanic white persons.

        </script>
    </div>

    <br>

      <p> The highest number of cases in Maryland have been located in Prince George's County. The county has the highest non-white population with 72.9%. According to the Maryland Department of Health, African-Americans account for the most cases with about 29% of the 71,447 confirmed cases.
      </p>

      <p>Across the U.S., African-American deaths from COVID-19 are twice the expected amount based on their percentage of the population. African-Americans also tend to have higher rates of preexisting conditions and less access to quality health care.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amid the pandemic, access to health care has been a struggle. The Department of Health and Human Services recently reversed nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people in terms of health care and health insurance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reversals especially affect the transgender population. The new rule defines "sex discrimination" as applying only when someone faces discrimination for being female or male. It will no longer protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, a definition previously determined by the Obama administration in 2016.
